# BRIDGE-model (Subfolder README)

This folder contains the files necessary to run the **BRIDGE (Biomedical Research Investment Dynamics and Growth Evaluation)** model.  

⚠️ **Note:** The free Personal Learning Edition of Vensim allows users to open the model and explore its structure and equations. However, running full simulations requires **Vensim DSS** software.  

For open access, you can instead use the **online simulator**:
