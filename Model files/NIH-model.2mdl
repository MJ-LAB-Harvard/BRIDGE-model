	~	Among the science, engineering, and health doctorate holders, an estimated \

		Employment sectors were classified into two broad categories: academia and \
		non-academia (government, for-profit, self-employed, nonprofit). Over \
		these 4 years, data show that while the majority of researchers remain in \
		their original sector, there is a net outflow from academia.The net change \
		indicates that academia lost approximately 6,350 researchers over four \
		years, which translates to an average annual net loss of about 1,590 \
		researchers per year to non-academic sectors.

This model simulates how changes in the NIH budget ripple through the U.S. biomedical research ecosystem over time. It links funding to workforce size, research output, clinical trials, and drug approvals, drawing on historical data and projected scenarios. Users can explore how sustained cuts, partial recoveries, or major investments may shape the system.
