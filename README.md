## Repository Contents  

This repository contains the **Vensim model file, datasets, replication files, and analysis code** used in the study. It enables researchers to:  
- Reproduce all results presented in the manuscript and Supplementary Information.  
- Modify parameters and structures to explore alternative assumptions.  
- Extend the framework for related questions in science policy and biomedical innovation.  

This repository aims for transparency, reproducibility, and extensibility of the BRIDGE model.

## Online Simulator  

An interactive version of the BRIDGE model is available at:  
ðŸ”— [NIH Budget Simulator](https://mj-lab.mgh.harvard.edu/nih-budget-simulator/)  

This simulator provides an **interactive online interface** to:  
- Test "what-if" scenarios.
- Visualize projected impacts on the biomedical research workforce, research outputs, and innovation outcomes.  
- Examine extended outcomes and scenarios not included in the main text.
  
**Note:** Running the model files here requires **Vensim DSS** software however, the online simulator is open-acess.  
In the background, the online simulator runs the model. It is designed as an interactive tool for **researchers, policymakers, and the public** to explore the long-term implications of changes to the NIH budget without software requirements.

## Data Availability  

All data sources, processed datasets, and replication files are publicly accessible. Details are provided in the manuscript and Supplementary Information.  

- NIH funding data: NIH Office of Budget & NIH Data Book  
- Workforce data: NSF GSS, SED, SDR surveys, and NIH ExPORTER
- Innovation data: PubMed, NIH ExPORTER, ClinicalTrials.gov, FDA records  
- Population data: U.S. Census Bureau  

The data imported into the model, as well as the data analysis codes, are hosted in this repository.
